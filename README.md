OpenCV Computer Vision Projects

A collection of hands-on Computer Vision mini-projects built using Python + OpenCV.
This repository showcases my practical understanding of image processing, real-time video analysis, face detection, template matching, feature extraction, and corner detection.

These scripts reflect my learning journey and demonstrate my ability to build real, working computer vision modules used in AI & ML projects.

🚀 Overview

This repository contains multiple small but powerful OpenCV programs including:

. 📷 Real-time webcam processing

. 🎨 Color detection & masking

. 🧩 Template matching

. 😀 Face detection using Haar cascades

. ✏️ Drawing shapes & annotations

. 🔍 Edge & corner detection

🖼️ Basic image transformations

Each Python file focuses on a different OpenCV concept, making this repo a great demonstration of my computer vision fundamentals.
